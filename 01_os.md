## Step 1 - Installing the OS on the MicroSD card:

In this step, we're going to install the operating system that will power the Raspberry Pi onto a MicroSD card.

1. Download the latest stable [Raspbian Buster Lite](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_lite_latest) image.

1. Following the [installation guide](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/mac.md), write the image to your MicroSD card. I went the manual route, and performed the following steps:
    - Insert the MicroSD card into the card slot on your computer, or a connected SD card reader.
    - Determine the location of the MicroSD card with `$ diskutil list`. Make note of the location - any reference to `/dev/diskN` throughout the rest of these instructions should be replaced with this location.
    - Unmount the MicroSD card with `$ diskutil unmountDisk /dev/diskN`.
    - Erase any protected partition tables with `$ sudo diskutil partitionDisk /dev/diskN 1 MBR "Free Space" "%noformat%" 100%`.
    - Copy the Raspbian Buster Lite image to the MicroSD card with `$ sudo dd bs=1m if=path_of_your_image.img of=/dev/rdiskN; sync`, replacing `path_of_your_image.img` with the absolute path to the image. This step may take several minutes.
    - Eject the MicroSD card with `$ sudo diskutil eject /dev/rdiskN`.
